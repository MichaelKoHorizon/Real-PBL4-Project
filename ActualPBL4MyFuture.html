                <h2>My Future:</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>At this point, I truly don’t know what my future will be; my future is uncertain, but I am excited for what could be.</p>
                <p>Next year (Senior year), I’m probably going to still be a part of the Programming pathway, but I don’t know what my schedule is going to look like. Whether I take on new challenges, new classes, or new experiences, I look forward to it and I suppose I'll find out soon enough. Whatever is going to happen next year, I’ll cross that bridge when I get there.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Beyond Academics, I’m going to do Track as a long-distance runner. I'm going to try to work on my strides/pacing and outside of track, I’m probably going to participate in both Science Fair as well as Codeathon. I don't mind taking on challenges and I'm a big fan of growing as a person.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As someone that wants to go to The Ohio State University, I'm going to get ready for college; I’m probably going to get ready for College. Hopefully, I’ll be able to go to Ohio State and get my degree there, but who knows..? No one knows exactly where life wil take them, and I am no exception.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Reflecting on where I’ve been, I can say with certainty that my time at Horizon Science Academy has been meaningful. I’ve grown, learned, and experienced moments that have shaped me into who I am today. Whatever the future holds, I carry those lessons forward, knowing that the journey continues.</p>
