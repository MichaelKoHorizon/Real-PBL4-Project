            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>Before high school, I didn’t have much direction and was just adjusting to normal life after COVID. As a freshman, I explored both programming and health sciences to see where my interests lay.
               By sophomore year, I leaned toward programming, taking an Object-Oriented Programming class and joining activities like Codeathon, Drone Club, and CoderZ. Now, as a junior, I’m in a web design class, expanding my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
               Looking ahead, I plan to take more programming courses, continue participating in Codeathon, and rejoin Drone Club. My ultimate goal is to build a career in computer science.

                <p>
                    Pre-high school, I had no plan for myself. I was just starting to get used to living normally (COVID). I was a a shell of my former self.
                    I got my act together as I transitioned into high school.

                <p>
                    Freshman year, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to be. As a result, I tried out both the programming and health pathways that the school had. I took Programming (CTE)
                    (Mr. Dal) as well as Health Science and Technology (Ms. Meldrum).

                <p>
                    Sophomore year, I was leaning towards the programming pathway. As a result, I was in Mr Dal’s Object Oriented Programming class.
                    This was the first year I participated in Codeathon. I was apart of the Drone Club and I did CoderZ.

                    I learned about HTML, CSS, and now I’m learning about JavaScript.
