                <h2>Freshman Year:</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    I was not exactly ready for high school as a freshman; going into a new school was something that I didn’t really want to experience, but I had to go through with it. I didn't really know what to expect from Horizon, so I entered school on the first day with an open mind.
                    Looking back, I would say that things went well for me during the first couple of weeks of school. I was able to get along with people, and no one bothered me too much.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    During my freshman year, I was apart of both the Health and Programming Pathways; I also tried doing many things. I joined Rocketry Club (Ms. Meyden) as well as Key Club (Ms. Meldrum). I made cards and created boxes for donations (Key Club) and for Rocketry Club, I enjoyed designing and creating rockets (I thought it was fun), and competing against other rockets was a cool experience (even though we didn’t do much).

                <h3>Health Science and Technology - </h3>
                <p>
                    For Health Science and Technology (Ms. Meldrum), the class focused on skills related to the healthcare field (especially during the first couple of months). We as a class worked on CareerSafe, where we answered questions related to communication, teamwork, critical thinking, as well as interview skills.
                    As the school year progressed, we learned about different medical terminology and worked on reading a book (The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks).  
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Programming - </h3>
                <p>During the first couple of weeks in Programming (Mr. Dal), we as a class got introduced to programming as well as software and hardware. We got introduced to common programming terms and the Internet. One of the first assignments we worked on was Building a Computer, where we had to find the following: </p>
                <p>- Find 5 Input devices for your business (how your business receives information)</p>
                <p>- Define the programming (what data will be received and how processed)</p>
                <p>- List 5 Output devices (how the information is communicated)</p>
                <br>
                <p>During the 2nd Semester, we as a class worked on Java (programming language) on Replit as well as CodeHS. We as a class practiced writing Java code on Replit as practice.</p>
