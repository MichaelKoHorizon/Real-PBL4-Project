                <hr>
                <p>I wanted to relax a little Junior year; I wanted to have time to myself, but I don’t think that happened…</p>
                <p>I am currently still a part of the track team; I do the 4*800 and the 800-meter race(s). I joined Mr. Ata’s Math Challenge Club and participated in Science Fair Competitions. I also participated in the NYFT Competition for Mr. Golding's class, and being able to present my business idea was pretty cool. Overall, I had a productive year as I achieved lots of things.</p>

                <p>
                   Before we as a class continued to learn more about HTML, we worked on our first class project. Our first class project (The Intersection of AI and Programming) was about creating a web application via Visual Studio Code, Scratch, and/or Code.org that mentions how Programming and AI is affecting Computer Science.
                   We spent 7-ish days on it, culimating in all of us presenting our projects in front of the entire class.

                <p>After our first project, we learned about HTML links, images, as well as tables. After that, we learned about audio tags, video tags, div tags, span tags, section tags, and more. As we were learning more and more on HTML, we started incorporating CSS to our codes/HTML assignments on Visual Studio Code. As this was happening,
                   we learned about the different stypes of CSS, the different types being - Inline Styling, Internal Styling, and External Styling.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Before Thanksgiving Break, between October 28th and November 22th, we learned about the Box Model (margin, border, padding, etc.) as well as HTML Forms. After Thanksgiving Break, we created an application using what we learned up to that period and we also reviewed what we learned for our Midterms. Once Midterms were complete, Codeathon began.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Before actually starting on Codeathon, we did a "practice run" where we created web applicatiosn using the Codeathon Topic from 2024. The practice run served a foundation for the actual Codeathon Competition that we would complete.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I participated in Codeathon for the 2nd year, and overall, our group did well. I worked with Hassan, Gemechu, and Antwan to create a Scratch game. Overall, it turned out well as we got 3rd place!</p>
