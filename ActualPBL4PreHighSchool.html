                    When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S. and forced schools to close, virtual learning became the norm. The pandemic gave me the time that I needed to reflect upon myself and what I wanted to be.
                    While I was doing virtual learning, I realized that I had to take control of my life. I tried to regain my ambition for my life and my passion for academics.
                    Around this time, I realized that pursuing higher education was in my best interest and that getting a college degree mind as well be a necessity for life. I used college as a motivational incentive for me to take back my life. This realization set the stage for my life in high school.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I entered high school with my motivation and drive for school restored. I took my classes seriously, I worked with my peers on group projects, and I engaged with my teachers. The results of my determination and effort led to this very moment. As I type out my story, I reflect upon myself.
                    I am proud of what I have been able to achieve so far, and I look forward to my future.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The experiences that I faced in my life have ultimately been a blessing in disguise for me since I now have the determination and ambition to achieve what I want to be. When I become an adult, I want to work in the IT field. I now have a clear goal for myself.
                    I unshackled myself from hatred and hopelessness and have created a positive mindset that will be significant to me. I am glad that I took the time to understand the importance of higher education.
